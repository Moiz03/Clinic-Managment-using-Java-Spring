# Clinic-Managment-using-Java-Spring

This web application is based on Java Spring and the databse is on MySQL.

This project is a web application where a patient can book an appointment, doctor can check all the appointments in a day and admin can add the timings of doctors and can add doctors and patients in a system.

Actually,I made this project almost 3 years ago, not remmeber much. I hope it will run on Netbeans or Intellij directly.
